GatoStream
==========

GatoStream born in one day work, to supply my need to watch more than one course (streaming) at the same time. In the begin it was made to be used only at terminal, but some friends also want to record some courses and shows while they were at work, but they were not so familiar with the terminal then I kept on with the development and create something easy to use which anyone can record streaming.

~~Soon I'll post the source and english version of the program.~~ (English and PortuguÃªs Brasileiro available)
